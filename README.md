# AltSchool Python Projects

## Project Overview

This repository contains a collection of Python projects that were completed as part of my coursework at AltSchool Africa. The aim of these projects was to help me practice foundational programming concepts such as:

- **Working with dictionaries** to store and manage data.
- **Using functions** to structure and organize code efficiently.
- **Implementing conditional statements** to make decisions based on various conditions.
- Writing **clean and readable code** following best practices for Python development.

## ðŸ›  Skills & Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Dictionaries
- Functions
- Conditional Statements

## ðŸ“‚ Project Files

Each project in this repository is contained within its own Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file. Here's a brief description of each project:

1. **Project 1: A Simple Food Ordering App**
   - The Simple Food Ordering App allows users to order food from a vendor offering three items: Pizza, Burger, and Noodles. Users can select multiple items in various quantities, and the app accurately captures their order, calculates the total cost, and displays a receipt. This app demonstrates how to handle user input, manage orders, and process simple calculations in Python.
   - **Skills practiced**: Working with dictionaries, using conditional statements, and implementing functions.

2. **Project 2: A Simple Bank App**
   - The Simple Bank App is a basic banking application that allows users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, update account details, and view account information. It simulates essential banking functions with features like generating unique account numbers and ensuring sufficient balance for withdrawals.
   - **Skills practiced**: Using functions, managing data with dictionaries, and implementing logic with conditional statements.
